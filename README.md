# Client

The client is an online retailer with a wide variety of products. They are interested in getting an idea of what insights they can pull from order data. Specifically, they are interested in the following
1. Growing sales
2. Getting new customers
3. finding new products to carry

   

# Scope

The client provided data for orders between December 2010 and December 2011. The data contains the following features:
'InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description', 'Quantity', 'InvoiceDate', 'UnitPrice', 'CustomerID', 'Country', 'ItemOrderTot', 'order hour', 'order day of week'


# Overview

We took a look at the clients data and broke down their areas of interest into more detailed questions, then analyzed the data to get answers to those questions. Along the way we did determine some other data points that would be helpful in getting even more insights from the data. 
1. Growing sales
   * Where are sales coming from?
       - One of the best ways to look for sales growth is to examine the best customers. Out of 4372 customers, the top 20% accounted for 49.9% of orders, .63.4% of revenue and 70.3% of all units sold.
       - Best selling products can give you an idea of what is appealing to your audience and help with choosing new products. The top 20% of products accounted for 81.8% of revenue.
     
3. Getting new customers
4. finding new products to carry



Insights
Given the Pareto Principle you would expect that the top 20% of customers would account for more orders and revenue, so there is likely some room to improve sales in that group. The top 20% of products are accounting for over 80% of revenue and at least one of them was included in 90% of orders.

Summary
The mix of products seems to be working well with the audience. We think that more can be done to drive sales among existing customers. We think new customer segments to focus on can be drawn from targeted consumers that are interested in the retailer's best selling products.
